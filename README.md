# ArmstrongNumbers
This project was to create a program that could identify 'Armstrong Numbers'. A number is called an Armstrong number if it is equal to the cube of its every digit. For example, 153 is an Armstrong number because of 153= 1+ 125+27, which is equal to 1^3+5^3+3^3. 

## Instructions to build and run
Open this project in Intellij, and open App.java. Within this class there is already an example given of an Armstrong Number, if you wish to test numbers against the program, then replace the number given.

## Platform limitations
There are no known limitations that would affect the running of this code.

## Dependencies 
For the testing aspect of this project I used JUnit.

## Possible Improvements
* If I were to do this project again I would separate the two methods that are in ArmstrongNumbers.java class.
* Another improvement would be to add more tests to improve my code coverage.
